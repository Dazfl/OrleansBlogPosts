# Orleans Blog Posts
A application to learn about Microsoft Orleans and test out various scenarios. I keep hearing how Orleans is one of the underrated frameworks from Microsoft.  I want to see if Orleans could be a good fit to replace how I've done things.

## Description
This project is a basic web api, with some basic CQRS functionality, to see how Orleans might work with a typical api.  .NET Aspire has been added to the mix as this is a fantastic framework for setting up infrastructure for your applications.

At this stage, the project has the ability to create a blog post, retrieve a list of blog posts and retrieve a single blog post by id.

## Features and Functionality to Test

Below is a list of features and functionality that I typically use in the projects I build. 

| Feature/Functionality | Capable |
|-----------|:-----------:|
| CRUD | - |
| Create records with unique constraints | - |
